## 4. Safety
- **Travel:**
  - We recommend using public transportation. If you use a bicycle or car, please obey all traffic laws and consider getting insurance.
  - We will share meeting and dismissal times and locations in advance. We use a buddy system (groups of two or more) for safety.

  - Events will be canceled or postponed in the case of severe weather. Please come prepared for both hot and cold conditions.

  - Do not take photos in dangerous areas, such as near rivers, railroad tracks, roads, or cliffs.
- **Emergencies:**
  - **Police: 110 / Fire & Ambulance: 119.** Organizers will share their mobile numbers for emergency contact.
  - Report any accidents or issues to the nearest organizer immediately.
- **Insurance:**
  - We recommend that students have their own insurance. We will follow university procedures for any necessary insurance claims.

  - Drones are generally prohibited, as they require special permits and adherence to strict regulations. They may only be used with prior approval from the organizers and after all legal requirements have been met.

## 5. Photography Etiquette
- **Public Spaces:**
  - Always check whether photography, tripods, and commercial use are permitted. Follow the instructions of staff.
  - Do not interfere with religious services or ceremonies.
- **Photographing People:**
  - Obtain consent before taking photos that clearly identify an individual. Verbal consent is acceptable, but written permission (or a chat record) is preferred.

  - Photos taken during club activities may not be used for commercial purposes without approval from the organizers and after securing all necessary rights.

  - The copyright of a photo belongs to the photographer. If the club wishes to use a photo for promotional purposes, we will obtain the photographer's permission and provide credit.
- **Portrait & Privacy Rights:**
  - We respect the rights of our subjects. If we receive a complaint, we will promptly remove the photo and take steps to prevent a recurrence.
