## 1. Our Philosophy
- To prioritize fun while valuing consideration for others, the community, and nature.
- Beginners and experienced photographers are both very welcome! Of course, smartphone photography is also okay.
- To respect diversity and value an attitude of learning from linguistic and cultural differences.
- To work together to grow our activities with the goal of becoming an official university club next year.
- If you wish to join, please contact the club president first. We will arrange a brief meeting to introduce the club.

## 2. Participation Rules
- **Registration:** If you want to join a photo trip, please let us know in advance via form or chat.
- **Be on time:** If you think you'll be late for the meeting time, please be sure to contact us in advance.
- **Attendance:** If you are absent multiple times without notice, we may need to discuss your future participation.
- **Conduct:** Alcohol, illegal activities, and dangerous behavior are strictly prohibited (both on and off campus).
- **Minors:** We will follow university rules and laws for underage members.

## 3. Attendance & Cancellation Policy
- **Cancellations:** Please try to notify us by 9:00 PM the day before. If you have a sudden illness or emergency, please let us know as soon as you can.
- **Pre-paid Costs:** If you cancel after the deadline for an event with pre-paid expenses, you may be asked to cover the cost.
- **Joining midway:** For safety reasons, joining an event after it has started is generally not allowed. If you have an unavoidable reason, please consult with the organizers.

## 4. Safety Guide
- **Travel Safety:**
  - We recommend using public transportation.
  - If you ride in a member's car, let's cooperate to lighten the driver's burden by sharing costs like gas and tolls. Please understand that this is based on the driver's personal kindness and prioritize safe driving.
  - We will share meeting/dismissal locations and times in advance. For safety, we will operate on a buddy system (groups of two or more).
- **Night & Bad Weather:**
  - Avoid going out alone at night. It's safer to wear bright clothing and carry a light.
  - In case of severe weather or warnings, activities will be canceled or postponed. Please prepare for both hot and cold weather yourself.
- **On-site Manners & Hazard Avoidance:**
  - Never enter "No Entry" or "No Photography" areas. Follow the facility's rules for using tripods and flashes.
  - We do not take photos in dangerous locations such as near rivers, railroad tracks, roads, or cliffs.
- **Emergency Contact:**
  - Police: 110 / Fire & Ambulance: 119. The organizers will share their mobile numbers for emergency contact on the day.
  - If an accident or trouble occurs, please report it to the nearest organizer immediately.
- **Insurance:**
  - We recommend that students get their own insurance. We will follow university regulations for any necessary procedures.
- **Drones:**
  - Using drones requires permits and legal knowledge. They are generally prohibited. They can only be used with special permission from the organizers and after all procedures are completed.

## 5. Photography Etiquette
- **In Public Spaces & Facilities:**
  - Check in advance if photography and tripods are allowed, and follow the instructions of the facility staff.
  - Avoid actions that could disturb others, such as during prayers or other ceremonies.
- **Photographing People:**
  - When taking a photo that clearly identifies someone, always ask for their permission first (verbal consent is okay).
  - For photographing minors, parental consent is required. It's also important to be considerate and refrain from taking photos depending on the situation.
- **Privacy Considerations:**
  - If personal information like license plates, addresses, or student IDs are visible, please mask them before publishing.
- **Posting on Social Media:**
  - Be careful with location information (it's safer not to disclose detailed home or school locations).
  - Follow the rules of the location where you took the photos and do not share photos that are prohibited from being posted.
- **Commercial Use:**
  - Photos taken during club activities are generally not for commercial use. In special cases, it may be possible with the approval of the organizers and after all rights have been cleared.
- **Consideration & Cooperation:**
  - Show respect for other members, local residents, and facility staff, and refrain from causing any trouble.
  - If a member's photography etiquette does not improve despite reminders, we may ask them to temporarily refrain from participating in activities to ensure the safety and comfort of all other participants.

## 6. Copyright, Portrait Rights, and Handling of Photos
- **Copyright:**
  - Belongs to the person who took the photo. If the club wants to use a photo for promotional purposes, we will get the photographer's permission beforehand and give them credit.
- **Portrait Rights & Privacy:**
  - We respect the feelings of the people in the photos. If we receive a request to delete a photo, we will respond promptly and take care to prevent it from happening again.
- **Data Sharing:**
  - When we ask for photos for official use (like on social media or in exhibitions), we will clearly state how and for how long they will be used.
  - For shared storage, we will specify who can see the files and how long they will be stored.
- **Credit Example:**
  - Â© Photographer's Name / KUAS Photography Club (Year)

## 7. Selection and Publication of Works
- **Official Publication:** The organizing team will select photos for official use (social media, exhibitions, flyers, etc.) after checking for technical quality, safety, and rights issues.
- **Editing:** We will respect the photographer's wishes and consult with them before making any edits.
- **NG Examples:** Photos taken in restricted areas, photos that identify individuals without permission, expressions that are discriminatory or harassing, or content that encourages dangerous behavior.

## 8. Equipment (Shared Camera) Loan Rules
- **Purpose:**
  - To support members who do not have a camera so they can also enjoy photography.
- **Eligibility & Period:**
  - Available to official members, generally for "return the day after the photo shoot." Longer loans require approval from the organizers.
- **Pick-up & Return:**
  - You will be asked to fill out a condition checklist. Let's also check the accessories (battery, charger, SD card, strap, etc.) together.
- **Handling:**
  - Always use the strap. Use a rain cover in the rain, and be careful around sand, seawater, and in hot and humid places.
- **Damage or Loss:**
  - Please report it to the organizers immediately. If it was broken intentionally or lost due to gross negligence, you may be asked to cover the repair costs.
- **Maintenance:**
  - Cleaning and updates are done by the organizers. The organizers will also decide on the replacement of items like protective films.
- **Memory Cards:**
  - Please do not save personal information. We ask that you back up and delete your data upon return.

## 8. Accounting & Cost Sharing
- **Basic Rule:**
  - Members pay for their own expenses like transportation, admission fees, and meals (some events may offer partial subsidies).
- **For Pre-paid Events:**
  - We will inform you of the estimated cost before you sign up. We will also specify the cancellation policy and refund availability.
- **Donations & Sponsors:**
  - The organizers will decide whether to accept them and will report to the members with transparency.
- **Equipment Purchases:**
  - When buying equipment for everyone to use, the organizers will make a proposal, and the decision will be made by discussion at a meeting.

## 9. How Meetings Are Run
- **Regular Meetings:** Mondays at 16:20 / 18:00 (S311). The agenda will be shared in advance.
- **Minutes:** We will record what was discussed, what was decided, and who is in charge, and share it with the members.
- **Decision-Making:**
  - Important matters are decided by the agreement of the attending organizers. If opinions are divided, we may decide by a majority vote.
- **Role Examples:**
  - President/Vice President, Treasurer, Equipment Manager, PR, Event Leader, Safety Manager, etc.

## 10. Communication & Emergency Contact System
- **Normal Communication:** We use Instagram, Teams/Email. Important notices will also be sent via Teams/Email.
- **On-the-day Communication:** For meetings and emergencies, we use the group chat designated by the organizers.
- **If Someone is Unreachable:**
  - If someone does not arrive by the meeting time and is unreachable, we may cancel or change the on-site activities for safety reasons.

## 11. Harassment Prevention & Code of Conduct
- Discrimination, harassment, threats, inappropriate physical contact, voyeurism, and stalking are prohibited.
- If you have any problems, please talk to an organizer. If necessary, we can also connect you with university counseling services.
- We will never allow any disadvantages to come to someone who consults us.

## 12. Handling of Personal Information
- We will be clear about the purpose of the personal information we collect and will not use it for any other reason.
- Contact lists are managed by a limited number of people. If information is leaked, we will report and deal with it immediately.

## 13. Revision of These Guidelines
- When reviewing these guidelines, the organizers will make a proposal, and the decision will be made after listening to everyone's opinions at a meeting.
- We will announce any important changes in the README and on our chat channels.
